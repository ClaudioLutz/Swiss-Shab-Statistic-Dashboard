# Documentation and Runtime Alignment

- Update README to match actual persistence (Parquet, not pickle) and the Python version required by `Pipfile`.
- Add a short “supported runtimes” section that clarifies local/dev expectations vs. production deployment.
- Outcome: contributors install the correct toolchain and understand the real storage layer.
